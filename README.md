# Chell CLI

Chell CLI is a powerful command-line interface tool designed to streamline Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), and testing processes for developers and QA engineers. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), Chell CLI simplifies environment configuration, test case creation, and cross-platform testing, making your work more efficient and productive. The tool allows you to interact using simple, human-like commands instead of complex scripts and YAML files.

## Key Features

- **NLP-driven interface**: Chell CLI uses OpenAI's GPT-4 API for Natural Language Processing, enabling users to interact with the tool using plain English commands.
- **Remote builds and testing**: Chell CLI integrates with AWS EC2 instances to spin up VMs and run tests in different environments, freeing up local resources and streamlining the development process.
- **Cross-platform support**: Chell CLI is designed to work with various platforms, such as web applications, mobile devices, and desktop applications.
- **Image interpretation**: Chell CLI leverages GPT-4's image interpretation capabilities to automate user tests without the need for a third-party computer vision library.
